# Description
In this lab, I installed and set up the required software tools for the course, including Chrome, Visual Studio Code (VSCode), and various VSCode extensions such as Prettier - Code formatter, ESLint, and GitHub Pull Requests and Issues. I also installed Node.js with npm, git, and Postman.

To become familiar with VSCode, I watched introductory videos and explored the interactive playground. I also reviewed tips and tricks and set up the Prettier - Code formatter extension as the default JavaScript code formatter.

In order to practice using terminal or shell commands, I navigated directories, created folders, and used commands specific to my operating system (Linux/Mac or Windows). I learned how to redirect command output to files, which proved to be quite useful.

Furthermore, I dedicated time to learning and using keyboard shortcuts in VSCode. I documented shortcuts for copying, pasting, cutting, saving files, toggling comments, moving and selecting text, and navigating within files. It was important for me to become proficient in using these shortcuts to improve my productivity.

The most exciting part was creating my first Node.js server-side JavaScript file. I wrote a JavaScript function to calculate the square of a number and used a loop to calculate and display the squares of even numbers from 2 to 10. I executed the file both from the VSCode terminal and using the Run and Debug feature in VSCode.

Throughout the lab, my main goal was to familiarize myself with the software tools required for the course, practice using them effectively, and lay the groundwork for future projects. By completing this lab, I gained a solid understanding of setting up the necessary software tools, leveraging the features and functionality of Visual Studio Code, executing commands in the terminal, utilizing keyboard shortcuts, and creating and running a basic Node.js server-side JavaScript file. These skills and knowledge will undoubtedly prove invaluable as I continue with the course projects.
